    blog: `<h3>Introduction:</h3>

Developing economies are going through a difficult time regarding their valuation
compared to the U.S. dollar. After opening the economy in 1991, India welcomed
the neoliberal economic regime. We allowed the private players to participate in
the country&#39;s economic growth. Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Institutional
Investment took a more significant role in the development and growth of the
social and financial sectors. International regimes like the World Trade
Organisation, Bilateral Investment Treaties, And Multilateral economic
arrangements benefitted Indian economies to perform better. In subsequent years,
we successfully adopted new technologies in our agriculture growth,
manufacturing, and service sector. 

<h3>Indian Scenarios</h3>

The role of different governments in our federal arrangements of rule at the union
and state levels promoted an investment-friendly ecosystem for both foreign
players and Indian industrialists. Various exemptions and reforms in the taxation
law, single window clearance, and special economic zones (SEZs) boost
employment opportunities for the available workforce.

In post-2000, digitization started in the banking sector, and automation took
vantage in the industrial and manufacturing sector. The &#39;computer system&#39; based
technologies helped to modernize various pillars of India&#39;s economy. That helped to
increase manufacturing capacity but consequently decreased the requirement of the
labor workforce. 

In recent years we are witnessing the consistent depreciation of the Indian rupee in
comparison to the U.S. $. in simple words, for the product or services, we need to
pay more Indian rupees. We cannot produce everything we need, so we import
from other countries using U.S. dollars. U.S. Dollar is the most accepted currency
in the international exchange rate system. As per the fundamental laws of
economics, if the demand for USD in India exceeds (by any reason, like our import
needs) its supply, then it’s worth will go up, and the INR will come down in that
respect. And its quick result here could be that the Foreign Institutional Investors
are retreating their investments in the country and taking them elsewhere. This can
create a shortfall in the supply of the Dollar in India and a fall in forex reserve. This
state of affairs can only be addressed by exporters who can bring in dollars. If, by
some means, the FIIs can be wooed back, then this imbalance can also be addressed
to a certain extent. 

<h3>Factors of Rupee Depreciation</h3>

Both international and national factors cause the depreciation of the rupee. These
are based on Geopolitics, the International fuel market, supply chain management,
War &amp; conflicts, Disaster, natural calamities, International frauds, and cybercrimes.
There may be pushing factors like government failure in any country, change in
political regime, the collapse of law and order, and poor policy framework in
countries of vital fuel and mineral resources. Here we are trying to understand the
recent events in the past few years that led to the fall in the purchasing power parity
of the Indian rupee in the International market. First, A sell-off in the global equity
markets, which was triggered by the hike in interest rates by the U.S. Federal
Reserve (central bank), the war in Europe, and growth concerns in China due to
the Covid-19 surge, led to the rupee depreciation. Second, The outflow of dollars
results from high crude prices; our energy demand of import crude is very high.
And the correction in equity markets is also causing the adverse flow of dollars.
And Third, The domestic tightening of Monetary Policy steps taken by the Reserve
Bank of India to counter rising inflation in the domestic market. 

These factors impact the overall Indian economy by depleting the foreign exchange
reserve and widening the current account deficit. With higher landed prices of
crude oil and other crucial imports, the economy is inching toward cost-push
inflation when overall costs increase (inflation) due to increases in wages and raw
materials, called cost-push inflation. The primary manufacturers and secondary
sector producers and suppliers may only partially pass on the burden of high costs
to consumers, which, in turn, affects government dividend earnings, raising
questions about budgeted fiscal deficits. 

<h3>Growth in Digital Transactions</h3>

To assess the growth of digital transactions and the use of digital currencies in the
Indian economy, first, there is a need to look into the technologies and the
platforms that operate and enables valid transactions. The faith of users in these
technologies is vital. Second, the Policy framework under the regulation of the
Reserve Bank of India ensures the smooth functioning of the safe and validity of
the rupee that people carry in digital forms. The rules of the banking system and the
various third-party internet and computer network-based applications&#39; performance
attract the user base. Digital payment transactions have significantly increased due
to coordinated efforts of the Government as a whole, along with all stakeholders
concerned, from 2,071 crore transactions in FY 2017-18 to 8,840 crore transactions
in FY 2021-22 (Source: RBI, NPCI, and banks). 

The history of money is fascinating and goes back thousands of years. From the
early days of bartering to the first metal coins and eventually the first paper money,
it has always had an essential impact on how we function as a society. The
innovations in cash and finance go hand in hand with the shifts in monetary history.
In its evolution till date, the currency has taken several different forms. It has
traversed its path from barter to valuable metal coins made up of bronze and copper
which later evolved to be made up of silver and gold. Somewhere along the way,
people improvised and instead of actual goods for barter they started using claims
on goods, a bill of exchange (RBI 2022).

The two significant events of the recent years of the Government of India pushed
users to use digital platforms to perform transactions. First, the Demonetizatisation
of large currency denominations of 500 and 1000 paper notes was banned on
November 8, 2016. That pushed users to carry the transaction in a cashless format.
This gives a boost to the platforms like Paytm, Google pay, and BHIM. These
applications are not doing the digital currency transaction, but whatever money we
carry in our bank account, that transaction happens in digital format. 

The digital currency ecosystem in the background of technology is quite different
than what we know about the simple cashless transaction from our mobile to any
shop or vendor displaying their QR codes commonly visible these days
everywhere. Digital transactions are simple and smooth in learning and performing.
However, the users and the merchants need to take care of basic cyber safety
behavior while doing so. Every rupee transaction is monitored by the respective
banks of which bank account we use while doing transactions based on the linked
bank account. 

<h3>Digital Currency</h3>

A digital currency is any currency that is available entirely in electronic form.
Many countries, including India, launched digital currencies in nations’ financial
systems. Digital currency, however, is exclusively exchanged through virtual
means and does not leave a computer network. The three major varieties of digital
currency are cryptocurrency, central bank digital currency (CBDCs) and
stablecoins (Kunal and Aashika, 2023). 
 Cryptocurrency is decentralized money, free from any government or central
bank’s chains. It relies on blockchain technology and uses cryptography to secure
transactions done by people making it impossible to counterfeit. Blockchain is a
digital ledger whose access is distributed between authorized users and records
transactions. The asset is free from governing bodies like central banks. This
mechanism makes Cryptocurrencies independent. At the same time, the centralized
money we use is monitored and managed by the RBI. 

Digital currency and cryptocurrency are different. According to the RBI, “a CBDC
is a legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is the same as a fiat
currency and is exchangeable one-to-one with the fiat currency. Only its form is
different. Unlike Cryptocurrencies, a CBDC isn’t a commodity or claims on
commodities or digital assets. Cryptocurrencies have no issuer. They are not money
(certainly not currency) as the word has come to be understood historically. 

In the international market, the value of the rupee is depreciating. Still, with
possibilities like transactions through UPI and the trade in the Indian rupee with
countries of mutual agreement, we can bypass the need for Dollar, at least with
some countries helping us to reduce the current account burden. 
International transactions in digital currencies need to ensure the learning and cyber
security of the financial system. At the national level, digital commerce and the use
of digital currency will boost the new and technology-friendly operators and
merchants. The overall market will grow.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Digital currencies are a faster mode of transaction. They help in cheaper global
transfers, and no need for intermediaries. They are available 24/7 to perform
transactions. All these transactions are happening under the monitoring of the
country&#39;s central banks, which will counter unsafe and illegal transactions. There is
surety in the national Government in digital currency, and that&#39;s the most prominent
element in maintaining users&#39; faith.
The broader impact of the use of digital currency on the depreciation of the Indian
rupee is yet to be asses. Still, the global transfers and use of digital currency in the
international market will help us to less dependency on US dollar and counter the
depreciation of the Indian rupee.
